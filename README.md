# Guess-the-number

A random fun game to guess a number with limited hit and trials.

It basically uses the random generator function to generate an n digit number where n is as per the user.Then from some ***optimal algorithm*** the user gets limited number of tries to guess correctly the number.

When the number guessed by the user is higher than the actual one then it indicates that number is **high** ; otherwise  **low**.
